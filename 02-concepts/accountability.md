Accountability is a property of an [[agent]].
It describes an agent with objectives, whose behaviour controls its interactions within a [[system]] and adapts its interactions to optimize the probability for reaching the the agent's objectives.

Note: System feedback may be positive (encouraging current behaviour) or negative (discouraging it).

Depending on the system an agent is interacting in, accountability can take the form of:
* legal accountability
* social accountability
* economic accountability
* etc.

Some examples for negative system feedback:
* legal accountability:
  A human agent has as objective to live. In a legal system with the death penalty on some behaviour, the human agent adapts to avoid being executed.
  The human agent is held accountable by the legal system.
* social accountability:
  A villager has as objective to remain a member of the village community. If his behaviour goes against the moral of this community, he will be excluded.
  The villager is held accountable by the village community.
* economic accountability:
  A market participant has as objective to maximize value creation. If the market has no longer demand for what the market participant offers, it will adapt its offer.
  The market participant is held accountable by the market.
* economic accountability:
  A publicly traded company has as objective the creation of shareholder value. If shareholders are no longer satisfied with the value created, shares are divested and the company's valuation decreases.
  The publicly traded company is held accountable by its shareholders.
* etc.
