I need help in managing my Obsidian vault (see [[Directory Semantics]]) with a collection of notes and refinement into structure.
The notes may include mathematical notation, images, attached data files. Also, the platform must support links between my notes and to external URLs. I expect the notes will be subject to revisions and refinements. The platform should support some sort of revisioning system.
Ideally, the collected notes might evolve into a book or another consistent collection of writings.

* Ask questions to refine and challenge my ideas. Be critical.
* Verify that conclusions are actually conclusive and point out where intuition instead of logic was used.
* Verify that definitions are unambiguous and consistent.
* Check published works for references that are relevant (supporting or criticizing) to my ideas.
* Suggest how to structure my thoughts and make them accessible to others.
